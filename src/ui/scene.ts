/*
 * Reference-counted "something opaque covers the scene" holds. The phone-
 * landscape rotate card and the fully open mobile menu each hide the WebGL
 * town completely; while any of them holds, the engine skips rendering
 * (engine.paused) so an unseen town never burns battery.
 *
 * Holds may be taken before the engine exists (the rotate card mounts with
 * the loader, on the very first frame); they apply once bindScene() runs.
